			<h3>Experienced</h3>
			<p> I have a BS in Engineering and years of exeperince in tutoring. Students who have graduted from my tutoring included those who have skipped or are simply working ahead in math, those who are years behind where they should be, those with learning disablities and those that just simply needed a little help.</p>

			<h3>Understanding</h3>
			<p> 99% of math problems arise from seeing math as a process to memorize rather than a language to comprehend. I do what it takes to get students to see the meaning behind the concepts(check out "visual fractions" a program I wrote for a student struggling with fractions.) This leads to students seeing an improvment in their grades and maintaining it without my help. </p>
