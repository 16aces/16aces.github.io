		  <h1>About Us</h1>
          
          <p>On July 20, 2013, Joshua Lee Carr, a resident of Hamilton, Virginia, lost his life while swimming in the Potomac River near Harper's Ferry, West Virginia. Josh had entered the water at <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?q=sandy+hook+maryland&amp;hl=en&amp;sll=37.752645,-77.912496&amp;sspn=0.022395,0.049567&amp;t=m&amp;hnear=Sandy+Hook&amp;z=15" target="_blank">Sandy Hook, Maryland</a>.</p>
				<p>Swimming and boating are popular sports at this stretch of the Potomac River. In July 2013, there were no warning signs at any of the entrances to the river. </p>
				<p>But the river at this stretch, where the Potomac and Shenandoah converge, is deceptively dangerous. The surface appears calm and inviting. Less than 10 feet below the surface, hidden from view, lies a swift-moving 35 knot current. Swimmers who are not wearing safety gear, and who venture too far from shore, have little chance of survival if they are caught in the current. Josh Carr swam too far, and lost his life within minutes.</p>
				<p>The Joshua Lee Carr Swim Foundation was established by the friends and family of Josh Carr with the goal of eliminating tragic swimming and boating accidents in the Potomac and Shenandoah Rivers. The Foundation is working to install signs along the river that caution swimmers and boaters to always wear life jackets. The Foundation also provides financial support to the fire and rescue departments responsible for water rescues in the Harper's Ferry area (the confluence of the Shenandoah and Potomac Rivers). The Foundation provides educational outreach to schools, churches, and Scouting organizations.</p>

</p>
          <p>Created in 2006 from the Loudoun Valley Cross Country Team and History Club at the School. We've had summers where not many people have come out but we carried on with the group growing and dwindling in size as people moved away. The times have changed as people have come and gone but the fun at Frisbee Club has aways carried on.</p>
